# Kmeans Clustering with Iris

This repository contains a small course project for an Introduction to Data Science class. The project demonstrates basic supervised and unsupervised learning techniques using the classic Iris dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore fundamental data science workflows, including:

* Data loading and exploration
* Data preprocessing
* Clustering methods
* Model evaluation and visualization

All main code, experiments, and results are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Structure

```
kmeans-clustering-with-iris/
├── notebooks/
│   └── Lab10.ipynb        Main notebook with code and results
└── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

Notes:

* notebooks/Lab10.ipynb contains the full implementation and analysis.
* The src and outputs folders are included as a basic project structure template for future extension.

## Methods Used

Depending on the notebook content, this project may include:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature visualization
* Clustering algorithms (such as K-Means)
* Performance metrics and plots

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/kmeans-clustering-with-iris.git
cd kmeans-clustering-with-iris
```

2. Install dependencies (example):

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open and run:

```
notebooks/Lab10.ipynb
```

## Dataset

This project uses the Iris dataset, which is publicly available and included in scikit-learn.

## Course Context

This project was completed as part of an Introduction to Data Science course assignment, focusing on basic machine learning concepts and practical experimentation.
